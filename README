This software comes with no assurance and my destroy your computer and electronic equipment.
I am not responsible for any damage created by this software.

Follow this istructions to make it work:


Install Apache2 and create a SQLite database. Firefox has an extention to manage SQLite database which will help you in this task.
Visit Firefox website to get the SQLite manager.

This release contains an HTML index file and a little favicon icon which you can change as you like.

The cgi-bin folder contains the Python code that will make the magic happen.

To run this software you need to configure Apache 2 properly! I've included a samle configuration to rewrite ther URLs. Be sure that
the rewrite module of Apache is ENABLE!

In the /etc/...whatever.../site-enable  folder; edit the configuration file as follow:

## THIS CODE MUST BE IN YOUR APACHE CONFIGURATION TO MAKE THE URL COMPRESSOR WORK ###

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin my@email.com

	DocumentRoot /var/www
	<Directory "/var/www/">
	    Order allow,deny
	    AllowOverride None
	    Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks
	    Allow from all
	    RewriteEngine On
            RewriteBase /
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
            RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /cgi-bin/query.py?shorturl=$1 [L,QSA]
	</Directory>
	<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin/">
	    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py
	    AllowOverride None
	    Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
	    Order allow,deny
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>
## This will allow to rewrite redirect any request to the webserver to to right webpage ##
